# Two-Key Encryptor and Decryptor System in Java

## What it can do

This project is a Java-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt data using a two-key mechanism. It supports:

- Encrypting strings into arrays of integers.
- Decrypting encrypted arrays back into readable text.

The program leverages ASCII value manipulation and prime number checks to enhance encryption security.

## What it doesÂ 

- **Encryption**: Converts a string into an encrypted array using two keys.
- **Decryption**: Reverses the encryption to retrieve the original string.
- **Prime-Based Encoding**: Includes an optional encoding step for prime ASCII values.
